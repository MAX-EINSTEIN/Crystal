# Crystal
A simple and generic C library for commonly used data structures and algorithms.
It tries to imitate the C++ Standard Library by providing a similar architecture of containers and iterators, also the functionality provided is similar.

## Warning : Work in progress (early development stage) , not suitable for use in production
### Completed:
+ vector          (Automatic and dynamically resizable array)
+ list            (Doubly Linked List)
+ slist           (Singly Linked List)
+ clist	          (Circular Linked List)
+ stack	          (Implemented with list)
+ queue	          (Implemented with list)

#### Other Miscellaneous Features:
+ string	(barebone implementation)
+ utility	(provides static_cast equivalent of C++ for C)
